open source (what do YOU think about when you hear the term "open source"? what are some advantages of open vs. closed source, what are some potential problems with open source, why did you decide to register for a class about open source software development?)

- When I think of open source, I think of code that is publicly available and allows anyone to contribute by submitting pull requests. One major advantage of open source software is that it brings in more contributors, which can lead to faster development and a wider range of perspectives. However, because anyone can submit changes, there is also the risk of low-quality pull requests, difficult-to-review code, or contributions that rely heavily on AI without proper oversight.

In contrast, closed source software typically ensures that contributors have a shared baseline of skills and follow established team or company conventions. With fewer people submitting changes, engineers can spend more time building features and fixing bugs instead of managing a large volume of code reviews.

I decided to register for this class because I’ve always been interested in contributing to open source projects but wasn’t sure where to start. I’m hoping this class will give me a solid foundation and help me learn how to engage with open source in a meaningful and effective way.


projects: briefly talk about four open source projects that you regularly use or that influenced you in some way in the past (note, the projects do not have to be source code based) (Keep in mind that these blogs are publicly available to anybody who stumbles upon them. Make sure that the posts are appropriate.)

Node.js and React are two huge open source projects that I didn't realize we open source until recently, I've used both for the front-end/Javascript work in my personal projects and internships. Docker has been pretty frequently used by me more lately through my software engineering class where I run locally the monggodb on docker and my research group that runs our postgres instance on docker. Kubernetes were something I had to interact with freuqently for over three months during my internship at Datadog. PostgreSQL is used often from my final project for Java and Web Design, my research group, personal projects and internships.
