Some information about you!

### More Information

I've been into tech since I was young but never took the leap to understand the technology I adored until college

I've done predominantly full stack experience but my interests are more backend. I'm really interested by the idea of getting into nicher fields such as networking and site reliabilty engineering

I love basketball and soccer! I grew up play basketball and fell in love with soccer more recently(just as a viewer)
